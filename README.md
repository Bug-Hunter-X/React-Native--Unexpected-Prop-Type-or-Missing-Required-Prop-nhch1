# React Native: Unexpected Prop Type or Missing Required Prop

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: providing incorrect prop types or omitting required props.  The error often manifests as unexpected behavior or crashes, and the error messages can be misleading.

## Problem

The `MyComponent` component expects a numerical `title` prop. Passing a string instead leads to unexpected behavior.  Additionally, forgetting to provide the required prop will also cause issues.

## Solution

Ensure all props are passed with the correct type and that required props are always provided. Using TypeScript or PropTypes can help catch these errors early during development.
