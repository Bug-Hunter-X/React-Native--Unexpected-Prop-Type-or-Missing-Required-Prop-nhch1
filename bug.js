This error occurs when you use a component that requires a specific prop but you either don't provide it or provide it with an incorrect type. For example, if a component expects a number for a prop, and you pass a string, you might encounter this error.  Another common cause is forgetting to pass a required prop altogether. 

```javascript
//Incorrect usage
<MyComponent title="123" />
//Correct Usage
<MyComponent title={123} />
```
